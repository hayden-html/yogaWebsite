This website is my first project that I'm practicing my skills on.
It is for my yoga teacher and I'm doing it commission free.
There are few few changes to be made such as:
A functional events page with the possibility of using the facebook event api, this needs to be discussed with hayley.
The form needs php added, this will email her the content.
Small jobs such as change of phot on the about page. Resize all photos and finish the href tags.

It will be intresting to try practicing sass on this document as I wrote alot of css.
